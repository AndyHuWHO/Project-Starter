# Personal Vocab Notebook

### AndyHu's CPSC210 Project


I am designing a simplified prototype version of a
**Vocabulary Notebook application** for 
Second Language Learning. This is an application 
I have envisioned for years.

This vocabulary notebook enables its users to store 
and review their **personalized** vocabulary 
information while studying a second language.
*Second language learners* will be the primary users
of this application. This app will let users store 
not only the words and their meanings 
and translations, but most
importantly, to store 
**the original learning context** 
of the words. Because this is a prototype version,
the original context will be in *text form* only at 
this stage, and in the future, it can take the form 
of *a short video clip, a short voice recording,
a picture, and etc*. So, the three main purposes of
this application are:

- let users store vocabulary items
- let users record and edit personalized information
for these vocab items
- let users review the vocab items and their 
related information

### User Stories

new vocabulary item to my vocab list

definition and translation with the 
vocabulary item

original learning context for particular 
vocabulary items

list of vocabulary items in my vocab list

- As a user, I want to be able to go into 
specific vocabulary items to edit and update
information attached to them
- As a user, I want to be able to delete
vocabulary items from the vocab list
- As a user, I want to be able to save my vocab list
automatically to file before terminating the app
- As a user,  I want to be able to be able to load 
my vocab list from file automatically when I start the app
